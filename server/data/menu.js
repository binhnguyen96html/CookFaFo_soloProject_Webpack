        "Bun Bo Hue is a spicy Vietnamese Beef Noodle soup that is not quite as popular as Pho but should not be overlooked! This authentic bun bo hue noodle soup is beefy, spicy & has a robust broth. If you love Pho and you love a bit of spice then definitely give Bun Bo Hue a try.",
      recipes: [
          "The Broth - Preparing the bun bo Hue broth is a detailed and time-consuming process that is rewarding. In my recipe, beef bone and lemongrass form the base of the broth, while annatto seed oil imparts color and sate chili oil adds spice. The broth-making process is a sophisticated one involving stewing the beef and pork bones. My broth is incomplete without the use of lemongrass, chile oil, and fermented shrimp paste. To keep the broth clear, you must occasionally skim the bubbles from the boil. This process maintains the broth clarity and helps retain a sweet but spicy taste. Fish sauce, which has a distinct umami flavor, is another of my go-to additions to the broth.",
          "Cha lua: Cha lua is a Vietnamese ham you can use as a topping for bun bo Hue. It is a steamed pork sausage that you can slice thinly to garnish your dish. Alternatively, beef tenderloin and sliced beef shank are also excellent garnishes.",
          "The Sate - spicy noodle dish has a chili paste that pairs perfectly with it. The chili oil or sate is the star of bun bo Hue. It is characteristically spicy, garlicky, and filled with lemongrass flavor. I make my sate using dried Thai chile, chili powder/flakes, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, and a bit of sugar. The sugar and shallots balance out the heat from the chili. In order to make a rich and savory paste, you need to rehydrate the chili in water, shred the other flavorings, and put everything in a skillet over medium heat till it becomes thick. I also add some fish sauce to the mix to heighten the flavors. Instead of fish oil, you can use shrimp paste. Shrimp paste locally made in Hue has a bright pink color and strong umami flavors. After the broth has been prepared, serve with a spoonful or two, depending on taste. To give diners more control over the spiciness, I typically serve the paste in a small bowl.",
          "Banana blossoms - Banana flowers are another common addition I make to bun bo Hue. Banana flowers can be quite difficult to find and prepare, so skip them if you cannot find banana blossoms. Many restaurants typically substitute banana flowers with thinly sliced red cabbage. However, to prepare, I remove the little fronds and petals and soak them in lemon water to prevent browning.",
          "Fresh vegetables - What is a Vietnamese dish without herbs? I use Thai basil, fish mint, red onions, bean sprouts, and lime wedges for our recipe.",
          "Pork Patty Roll - Cha lua is a Vietnamese ham you can use as a topping for bun bo Hue. It is a steamed pork sausage that you can slice thinly to garnish your dish. Alternatively, beef tenderloin and sliced beef shank are also excellent garnishes.",
